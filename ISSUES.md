# [T]issues

This file will list the known issues. If you want one to especially be worked on create an issue in github if it doesn't already exist. If it does already exist then just comment on the existing issue with some sort of reasoning why you want it worked on.

## Animations

- Animating views with inset shadows is slow
- Animating views with shadows and cornerRadius in safari is slow. Somehow in chrome it's fine though
- Animating lots of views
- Race condition when adding a new animation when an animation already exists

## Views

- No true hierarchy. Cannot `addSubView` on a given view
- No scrollview
- No textview
- No tableview
- No collectionview
