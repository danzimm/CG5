# Base Framework
- paths for views i.e. create a bean - allow them to mutate just one leg at a time
- shadows - inset + outset
- colors - create color object
- point,rect,size classes

# Options
- Make it so you can "hook" any method, i.e. signals sent when method called - add to synthesizeproperty/dynamicproperty - possible add function which simply creates a closure with the origin imp and then replaces imp w/ hook
