# Base Framework
- paths for views i.e. create a bean - allow them to mutate just one leg at a time
- scroll view
  - table view
  - collection view
  - text view

# Options
- Make it so you can "hook" any method, i.e. signals sent when method called - add to synthesizeproperty/dynamicproperty - possible add function which simply creates a closure with the origin imp and then replaces imp w/ hook
