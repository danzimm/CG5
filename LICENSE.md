> One is not allowed to download the files from this repo and then claim the work is his own. If one modifies the files, he is not allowed to claim the code is entirely his own.

Although no legal actions will be taken to enforce the above, please be a good person and give credit where credit is due. I, Dan Zimmerman, am not looking for the credit personally, I just don't want other people to take credit for something they did not do.
